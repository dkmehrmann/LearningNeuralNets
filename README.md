# LearningNeuralNets

Learning Neural nets through fun, interactive examples instead of dense, complicated math notation.

## Purpose

Math is a concise way to explain complicated concepts (like neural nets), which is why so many neural net tutorials look like PhD theses. I intent to give a math-light, natural language overview of neural nets for people who suck at math, like me.
